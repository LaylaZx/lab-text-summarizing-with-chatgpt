    "#Hare and Tortoise story\n",
    "story = \"\"\"Once upon a time, in a lush, green forest, lived a hare who was known for his speed. He could run faster than any creature in the entire forest. His fur was sleek, his legs were long and powerful, and he was always the first to arrive at any gathering. The other animals in the forest often admired him and would watch in awe as he zipped past them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But despite his impressive abilities, the hare was arrogant and loved to boast. \"I am the fastest animal in this forest!\" he would say, \"No one can outrun me. I'm the king of speed!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, as the hare was strutting through the forest, he came across a tortoise who was moving at his usual slow and steady pace. The tortoise was old and wise, but his slowness was often the subject of ridicule among the other animals. The hare, seeing the tortoise's deliberate movement, burst out laughing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You! You are so slow! How do you even get around the forest? You should just give up. You'll never be able to keep up with me!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The tortoise, undeterred by the hare's mockery, responded calmly. \"I may be slow, but I am determined. How about we settle this with a race? I may not be fast, but I believe I can win.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The hare, who was always looking for an opportunity to show off, scoffed at the idea. \"A race? With you? This will be over before it even begins! But sure, I'll humor you. Prepare to lose.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The animals of the forest gathered around to watch the race, eager to see how it would unfold. The fox was chosen to be the referee, and he called them to the starting line. \"The finish line is just beyond the tall oak tree on the other side of the meadow,\" the fox announced. \"Are you ready?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The hare nodded confidently, already picturing himself at the finish line while the tortoise was still at the starting point. The tortoise simply nodded, keeping his eyes focused on the path ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the signal, the race began! The hare shot off like an arrow, his legs moving so quickly that he seemed to blur. Within seconds, he had left the tortoise far behind. The tortoise, on the other hand, moved at his usual steady pace, his legs plodding along without haste. He didn’t look around or worry about the hare’s speed; he simply kept moving forward, one step at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the hare raced ahead, he looked back and saw that the tortoise was nowhere in sight. \"This is too easy,\" the hare thought. \"I have plenty of time to take a nap before I finish the race.\" Feeling confident and sure of his victory, he found a soft patch of grass under a shady tree and decided to rest. \"I'll sleep for a while,\" he thought, \"and then I'll finish the race in no time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the hare curled up under the tree, closed his eyes, and drifted off to sleep. Meanwhile, the tortoise kept moving steadily along the path, never stopping, never rushing. He moved with purpose, despite the growing distance between him and the hare.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the hare slept, the tortoise reached the halfway point, then the three-quarters point, and before long, he was nearing the tall oak tree that marked the finish line. The other animals in the forest watched in awe as the slow-moving tortoise approached the end of the race, his determination unwavering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the hare continued to sleep soundly, unaware that the tortoise was nearing victory. He dreamed of the finish line, imagining how proud he would be when he crossed it in first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then, the tortoise reached the finish line. The crowd of animals cheered, and the fox declared, \"The tortoise wins the race!\" The tortoise, though tired, smiled proudly, his slow and steady pace having won him the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few moments later, the hare woke up, stretching and yawning. He glanced around, expecting to see the tortoise far behind him. But to his shock, the tortoise was already at the finish line, surrounded by cheering animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hare's heart sank as he realized what had happened. He had been so sure of his victory, so confident in his speed, that he had underestimated the tortoise. He raced to the finish line, but it was too late. The tortoise had won.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hare, out of breath and embarrassed, hung his head in shame. \"How could I have been so foolish?\" he thought. \"I was too arrogant, too overconfident, and now I’ve lost.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The tortoise, seeing the hare's distress, approached him with a kind smile. \"You were fast, my friend,\" the tortoise said gently. \"But you forgot one thing: speed is not always the most important thing. It’s about consistency, persistence, and not giving up. I may not be fast, but I kept going, step by step, and in the end, that made all the difference.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The moral of the story was clear to everyone in the forest: \"Slow and steady wins the race.\" It was a lesson in humility for the hare and a reminder to everyone that persistence, determination, and steady effort can often lead to success, even if you are not the fastest or the strongest.\n",
    "\n",
    "From that day on, the hare learned to be more humble and never again underestimated the power of consistency and patience. And the tortoise, with his quiet wisdom, continued to move at his own pace, knowing that sometimes, in life, persistence is the key to achieving great things\"\"\""
